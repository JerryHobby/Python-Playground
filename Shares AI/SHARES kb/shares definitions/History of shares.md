# SHARES Airline Reservation System: A Brief History

## Creation and Early History
- **Developed by:** SHARES was originally created by **PARS Service Partnership**, which was formed by **Continental Airlines** and **Eastern Airlines** in the early 1980s. The goal was to develop a next-generation reservation system that could serve both airlines after their split from the larger **SystemOne** reservation system.
  
- **Launch Date:** SHARES was officially introduced in 1987, focusing on providing enhanced reservation management, ticketing, and inventory control to airlines.

## Evolution and Ownership
- After **Eastern Airlines** ceased operations in 1991, **Continental Airlines** continued using and developing SHARES.
- SHARES became more prominent when **Continental Airlines** merged with **United Airlines** in 2010. Following the merger, **United Airlines** initially chose SHARES as its primary reservation system.
- In the early 2010s, SHARES was modernized and integrated with other backend systems at **United Airlines**, including customer service and frequent flyer programs.

## Usage Today
- **Current Users:** SHARES is predominantly used by **United Airlines** today, though it may still be in use by a few other smaller airlines or service providers.
  
  While **United Airlines** has made extensive efforts to modernize its infrastructure, including the adoption of newer technology platforms, SHARES remains a core part of its reservation and operational systems, especially after the airline consolidated all customer and reservation data onto SHARES during the merger with Continental.

## Features and Capabilities
SHARES is known for its traditional green-screen interface, which is common among legacy airline systems. However, over the years, it has incorporated more modern features and web-based interfaces for certain functionalities.

- It handles **reservation management**, **inventory control**, **ticketing**, and **passenger services**.
- SHARES integrates with various other systems for airport operations, cargo handling, and loyalty programs.

## Transition to Modern Systems
Many airlines have moved away from legacy systems like SHARES to more modern, scalable, and cloud-based reservation systems, such as **Amadeus**, **Sabre**, or **Navitaire**. However, SHARES continues to serve **United Airlines** and remains a key part of the airline's infrastructure.
